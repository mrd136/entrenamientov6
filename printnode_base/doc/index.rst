Steps for PrintNode
###################

|

1. Sign up for `PrintNode <https://www.printnode.com/en>`_ to create a new account and generate an API key.
2. To use PrintNode you need to install and run the `PrintNode Client <https://www.printnode.com/en/download>`_ software on a computer that has access to all your printers in your network and is connected to the internet. (By the default Pricing Plan PrintNode supports installation of the client software on three different computers, but you can add more devices at any time.)
3. Open the API menu and copy `your API key <https://app.printnode.com/app/apikeys>`_ for later use.

|

|

8. Go to user preferences, set up the default printers, and click in the "Print via PrintNode" checkbox (if the checkbox “Print via PrintNode” is set, then all documents will be auto-forwarded to the printer instead of downloading in PDF).

|

9. That's it, you can now print directly on your default printers. Try to print any document, and make sure your printer is switched on!

If you need to set up an additional condition for print action buttons (e.g. print delivery slip only in the Delivery zone, or for deliveries shipped to particular countries) you should define Domain

Leave the field "Printer" blank for print action button in case you need to print reports on user's printer (set up in user preferences)

FAQ
###

|

*1. Does every computer in the company that needs to print, need to install the nodeprint client app on the local computer? Or only the computers where the printer is physically attached?*

|

It's enough to have only one machine that has access to all needed printers.
We even recommend to set-up a separate PC for this. E.g. we configured a Raspberry PI 4 in our office for printing purposes.
It's absolutely doesn't matter where are the printers and connected to a local or external network. If the printnode client sees them, you can print.

|

*2. Are there any limitations on the side of hosting Odoo? We use Docker/Kubernetes based deployments. Are you aware of any issues with such environments?*

|

No issues if your Odoo server has internet access.

|

*3. I see you use cups as printer server. How does this work on odoo.sh Do we have to make a vpn connection between odoo.sh and the warehouse?*

|

No need to make VPN connection. You will just need to install special PrintNode Client on any local machine in your network with printers. CUPS will be needed only if this machine will be linux based.

Troubleshooting
###############

|

If the system downloads reports instead of printing them, please check that the "Print via PrintNode" checkbox has been ticked:
